if you want to merge in master branch then you have to come in master branch and then merge the other branch.
if you are at master branch after merge  you can simply push by git push
if you after merging you go on merge branch and want to push then you have to say git push origin master
same thing for other branch if you are on master banch after merging with tan branch and you want to puch changes on
remote tan branch then you will write git push origin tan.
If you are at tan branch and want to merge with master branch you need to come on maste branch for merging.
